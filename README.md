BetterTether is a lightweight userspace daemon that brings high-performance USB tethering to macOS by implementing the RNDIS protocol via `libusb` and routing traffic through the native `utun` interface. It ships with a native macOS desktop app for controlling the daemon, monitoring traffic, and viewing logs from the menu bar.

## Why BetterTether?

- **Zero System Security Changes**: Unlike HoRNDIS, BetterTether runs entirely in userspace. You don't need to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) or allow reduced security mode.
- **Universal macOS Support**: Native builds for both Apple Silicon (M1–M5) and Intel Macs.
- **All Android Phones**: Handles dynamic MAC address randomization across all Android devices, not just Samsung.
- **Plug & Play**: Automatically detects your phone, performs the handshake, and configures your Mac's routing/DNS instantly.
- **Desktop GUI**: Native macOS app with power button, traffic stats, log viewer, settings panel (uninstall, clear logs), and system tray menu — quits cleanly without leaving the daemon running.

## macOS 15+ (Tahoe) Compatibility Guide

For use with Surge Mac Enhanced Mode, see [Using BetterTether beneath Surge](docs/SURGE.md).

macOS 15 introduces a strict "System Trust" model for network interfaces. BetterTether operates within these boundaries, leading to a split-networking experience:

### Works Out-of-the-Box (Independent Apps)
Apps that use their own internal network or DNS libraries (DNS-over-HTTPS) bypass the OS "reachability" checks and work at full speed instantly:
*   **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Microsoft Edge.
*   **Meetings**: Google Meet, Zoom, Slack, Microsoft Teams.
*   **Streaming**: Netflix, YouTube, Spotify, Twitch.
*   **Developer Tools**: Any connection to a raw IP address.

### Safari, App Store, and System Updates (Fixed)
BetterTether properly registers the `utun` interface as the **primary network service** in the System Configuration dynamic store. Safari, App Store, and system software updates work without any extra configuration.

### Pages Hanging or Spinning Forever? (The MTU Black Hole)
If you can ping `8.8.8.8` but websites fail to load, your mobile carrier might be dropping packets that are too large (a common 5G tethering issue). Fix by lowering the interface MTU to 1380:
```bash
sudo ifconfig utun6 mtu 1380
```

## Security & Privacy Posture

BetterTether is built on a strict **"local-only"** and **"least-privilege"** security model.

### Zero Telemetry & Data Sovereignty
- **No Data Inspection**: BetterTether simply routes encrypted and unencrypted packets between the macOS kernel (`utun`) and the Android USB interface (`libusb`). It **does not** read, inspect, or modify the contents of your web traffic.
- **No Analytics**: There is absolutely zero telemetry, tracking, or "call-home" functionality.
- **Local Logs Only**: Operational logs reside strictly on your local machine at `/var/log/bettertether.log`.

### Why `sudo` (Root) is Required
1. **Virtual Interface Creation**: Creating the `utun` interface requires kernel routing permissions.
2. **Routing Table Modification**: Injecting routes to prioritize the Android connection requires root.
3. **Hardware USB Binding**: Opening raw protocol communication via `libusb` requires device-level access.

### 100% Auditable Core
The core routing logic is written in modern Go and consists of fewer than **2,000 lines of code**, making it trivially auditable.

## Installation

### Option 1: Download the DMG
Download the latest `BetterTether-*.dmg` from the [Releases](https://github.com/s4wbvnny/BetterTether/releases) page. Mount it and drag `BetterTether.app` to your Applications folder.

**First launch:** Since BetterTether is downloaded from the internet, macOS Gatekeeper will block it the first time you open it. To allow it:
1. Try to open BetterTether — you'll see *"BetterTether can't be opened"*.
2. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.
3. Scroll down — you'll see a message about BetterTether being blocked. Click **Open Anyway**.
4. Verify using your biometrics or password.

This only needs to be done once. After that, BetterTether opens normally.

The app will install the background daemon on first launch (requires admin password).

### Option 2: Homebrew
```bash
brew install --cask s4wbvnny/tap/bettertether
```
To update to the latest release:
```bash
brew update && brew upgrade
```

### Option 3: One-Liner Install
```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s4wbvnny/BetterTether/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

### Option 4: Build from Source

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
brew install libusb pkg-config go node
```

**Build the daemon + GUI app:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/s4wbvnny/BetterTether
cd BetterTether
make app
```

The `.app` bundle will be at `build/BetterTether.app`. Drag it to Applications.

**Or build a DMG installer:**
```bash
cd gui
npm run build
npx electron-builder --mac dmg --arm64 --x64
```

DMGs will be in `gui/dist/`. Use the `--arm64` flag for Apple Silicon only, or `--x64` for Intel only.

## How to Use

1. **Launch BetterTether.app** — it appears in the menu bar and dock.
2. **Connect** your Android phone to your Mac via USB-C.
3. **Enable USB Tethering** on your phone (Settings > Tethering > USB Tethering).
4. Click the **power button** in the app to start the daemon.

The app shows real-time traffic stats (uploaded/downloaded), connection status, and a live log viewer. Use the Settings panel to clear logs or fully uninstall the daemon. Quitting via Cmd+Q or the tray menu stops the daemon cleanly but keeps it installed for next time.

---

## Uninstalling

### Uninstall Command
If `bettertether-uninstall` was installed alongside the daemon:
```bash
sudo bettertether-uninstall
```

### Manual
```bash
sudo bash uninstall.sh
```
---

## Troubleshooting

### "BetterTether can't be opened"
macOS Gatekeeper blocks apps downloaded from the internet that aren't signed with an Apple Developer ID. BetterTether is ad-hoc signed, so you need to approve it once:

1. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.
2. Scroll down to the **Security** section.
3. Click **Open Anyway** next the BetterTether message.
4. Authorize using your biometrics or password.

Alternatively, you can clear the quarantine flag from the terminal:
```bash
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/BetterTether.app
```
Then relaunch BetterTether. Either method only needs to be done once after installing from a DMG download.

### "Missing libusb on first launch"
If you should encounter this error on your first launch the command below is an easy fix:
```
brew install libusb
```

Launch the app again and enjoy!
